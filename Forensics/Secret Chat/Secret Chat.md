# Secret Chat
## Challenge Description
The challenge provides us a pcap file and requires for us to find the conversation between two people held over TCP.

## Solution Walkthrough
We use Wireshark to examine our pcap file.

Since there are many packets we need to filter the ones we need. So we got to _Statistics_ then _Protocol Hierarchy_.

There under Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) we choose data to look for the chats.

Then we right click to _Follow TCP Stream_ and we get the chat.

Clearly the string 'v2FubmFIYWNre1RDUF9FTkMwREVEX0NINFR9' is our flag in base 64 encoded format.
After using a decypher tool like [dcode](dcode.fr) We get our flag!
