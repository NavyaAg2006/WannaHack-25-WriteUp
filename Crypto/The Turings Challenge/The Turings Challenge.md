The Challenge directly gives us the flag in encoded format. all we need to do is figure out the encryption method and decrypt our flag.

## Solution Walkthrough
According to the hints we can clearly see that it's a rotor based cypher. Since so many specification are given we can use then in the Enigma Machine cypher.
We can use a website like [dcode](dcode.fr) to decrypt our flag. Enter the details accordingly and we get our flag!
