The challenge provides us with an image file and the hint states-
> Sometimes, what you’re looking for is right in front of you—but you might need to look closer, or from a different perspective. Examine the image carefully; subtle clues might lead you to the answer.

## Understanding the task
On examining the image-

The Image has LSB written, which stands for least significant bit. We know that in steganography the least significant bit of each character is changed since it makes a very slight, unnoticable change thus a message can be hidden easily.

So we use steganography tools in order to extract the least significant bits. one such tools is [Steganography Online](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/).
On uploading the image we get the flag!
